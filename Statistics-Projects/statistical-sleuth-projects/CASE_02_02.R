# CASE
# Early studies, based largel on postmortem analysis,
# suggest that the sizes of certain areas of the brain may be different
# in persons afflicted with schizophrenia than in others.
# In a 1990 article, researchers reported the results of a study
# that controlled for genetic and socioeconomic differences by examining
# 15 pairs of monozygotic twins
# where one of the twins was schizophrenic and the other was not.

# What is the magnitude of the difference in volumes of the left hippocampus
# between the unaffected and the affected individuals?
# Can the observed difference be attributed to chance?
